# Aperture
A Minecraft plugin that adds security cameras to your Spigot server.

## What makes Aperture different?
A lot of other security camera plugins out there tend to teleport the player for the "effect" of the camera. However,
this breaks immersion when the player is in another dimension, or otherwise takes a while to load the camera's chunks.
Aperture works by reading the camera's view and sending the player the corresponding block packets. The result is
(in my opinion) much cooler, faster, and convenient.

## Where did this come from?
This used to be a Premium resource of mine on Spigot. However, after losing interest in the Minecraft modding scene, I
decided to publish the source code for free. I welcome any and all contributions if you feel this plugin can be made
better.
